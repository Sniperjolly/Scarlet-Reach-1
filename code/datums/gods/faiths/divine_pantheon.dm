	name = "Divine Pantheon"
	desc = "The TEN, children of PSYDON. The most accepted religion in Scarlet Reach. They were born from Psydon’s will for companionship and were His collaborators on shaping the Enigma. For a millenium the <b>Universal Church</b> was a church of Nine, including the God of Gods, Psydon and excluding the fallen and disloyal gods of the wild Abyssor and Dendor. \n\ \n\
		The death of PSYDON and the rise of ZIZO was a catastrophe for the Universal Church. The priesthood of Astrata, Psydon’s most loyal servant and patron of the church humbled themselves and reconciled with the wild gods, uniting the Divine Family once more. \n\ \n\
		Many faiths across the Enigma hold sacred some or all of the Ten, and some even recognize the heretical ‘Ascendants’ as True Divinity. The Universal Church however has united many disparate faiths under one roof, as the gospel of reconciliation and the evidence of Psydon’s death becomes harder to deny. Strong and united if not strongly united, the Ten stand as bulwarks against the Inhumen."
